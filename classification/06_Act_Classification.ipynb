    "## Brief Description of the Dataset\n",
    "The dataset provides detailed information on Filipino households’ **annual income**, **sources of earnings**, and comprehensive **patterns of expenditure**. It contains both quantitative (numerical) and categorical features that describe the household’s socio-economic profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Number of Rows and Columns:** 41544 rows and 60 columns\n",
    "* **Sample Variables:**\n",
    "    * `Region` – geographic region of the household (Categorical)\n",
    "    * `Household_Head_Age` – age of the family head (Quantitative)\n",
    "    * `Education` – highest educational attainment (Categorical/Ordinal)\n",
    "    * `Family_Size` – total number of family members (Quantitative)\n",
    "    * `Total_Income` – total annual family income (Quantitative)\n",
    "    * `Food_Expenditure`, `Education_Expenditure`, `Housing_Expenditure`, etc. – detailed spending categories (Quantitative)\n",

    "## Machine Learning Task Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Features (Independent Variables)\n",
    "The model will utilize a combination of socio-demographic and spending-related factors as input features, including:\n",
    "* Region\n",
    "* Education level and age of household head\n",
    "* Family size\n",
    "* Major expenditure categories (food, housing, education, transportation, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target / Label Column (Dependent Variable)\n",
    "The target variable is the engineered class label: `Income_Class`. This represents a **Binary Classification** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Label | Group | Definition |\n",
    "| :---: | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **0** | **Low-Income Group** | Families with an annual income at or **below** the national median income. |\n",
    "| **1** | **High-Income Group** | Families with an annual income **above** the national median income. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective of the Study\n",
    "The objective is to build a robust **machine learning classification model** (e.g., Random Forest) that accurately predicts whether a Filipino family belongs to the High-Income (1) or Low-Income (0) group based on their observed demographic characteristics and expenditure patterns. The study aims to identify the key features that drive this economic classification, providing insights for targeted poverty or welfare policies."
