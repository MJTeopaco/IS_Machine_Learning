    "# Predicting Real Estate Prices in the Philippines Using Random Forest Regression\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "The real estate industry plays a vital role in the Philippine economy, with property values influenced by numerous factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and property type. Accurately predicting real estate prices can help buyers, sellers, and investors make data-driven decisions and ensure fair market valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices in the Philippines using various property-related features from the Kaggle dataset “Real Estate Price in the Philippines.” The project aims to model the nonlinear relationships between these features and property prices \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- To train a Random Forest Regression model for predicting property prices.\n",
    "- To analyze the relationship between property features and their market prices.\n",
    "- To determine the most important features affecting real estate prices.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. Data Collection\n",
    "The dataset used in this study is titled “Real Estate Price in the Philippines”, sourced from Kaggle. It contains real estate property listings collected from various sources across the Philippines, including property-selling websites and market reports. Each record represents a property, with corresponding features such as price, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and area. The data captures the key characteristics influencing housing value and reflects current trends in the Philippine real estate market."
