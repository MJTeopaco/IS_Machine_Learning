    "## Summary Interpretation:\n",
    "1. **Gradual Increase in Explained Variance** - From the plot, the first few components capture only a small portion of the variance (e.g., PC1 to PC10 account for ~40%). This suggests that the dataset does not have very strong dominant directions of variance—instead, the information is spread across many dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steady Climb Toward 90% Variance** - As more components are added, the cumulative variance increases smoothly, showing that each component still carries meaningful information. There is no sharp “elbow,” meaning no small set of components captures most of the data structure. This indicates the dataset is highly multidimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **90% Variance Achieved at 50 Components** - The intersection of the green vertical line and the red horizontal line shows that it takes 50 principal components to capture 90% of the total variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **This means:**\n",
    "- The original 76-dimensional dataset can be reduced to 50 dimensions while keeping almost all (90%) of the information.\n",
    "- Although 50 components may seem high, this is still a 34% reduction in dimensionality (76 → 50).\n",
    "- No small set of PCs (<20) captures most of the information."
